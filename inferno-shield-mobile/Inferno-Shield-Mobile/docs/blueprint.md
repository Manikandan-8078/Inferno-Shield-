# **App Name**: Inferno Shield Mobile

## Core Features:

- Real-Time Fire Alerts: Display real-time fire alerts via push notifications and loud alarm tones.
- Live Situation Updates: Show a live feed of triggered sensors and the fire's location on a building map.
- Custom Emergency Contact List: Allow users to manage a list of emergency contacts (owners, managers, security, fire dept, police, ambulance) and configure auto-call/message triggers.
- Employee Safety Messaging: Facilitate broadcasting of evacuation instructions and zone-specific alerts to employees.
- Integration with Suppression Control: Enable triggering manual override of suppression guns and monitoring of suppression effectiveness.
- Incident Log: Provide a complete incident timeline with sensor logs, response times, and communication records for post-event review.
- AI-Powered Safety Recommendations: The system should have a tool which analyzes data and provides customized safety recommendations, which will be included to incident logs after the incident is over.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep red (#B81E1E) to evoke a sense of urgency and danger, reinforcing the app's core function of alerting users to fire hazards.
- Background color: Dark gray (#2A2A2A) to provide contrast with alert elements and reduce eye strain in stressful situations.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#FF9500) to highlight critical interactive elements like manual override buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and easily readable interface.
- Use clear, recognizable icons related to fire safety (e.g., flame, building, alert) with a consistent style.
- Design a dashboard with a clear visual hierarchy, prioritizing active alerts and essential information (e.g., sensor status, building map). Color-coded zones (red = critical, yellow = warning) should be prominently displayed.
- Incorporate subtle animations to draw attention to active alerts and changes in sensor status. These should be fast and direct, like icon changes or zone pulses.
